  abstract = {In this paper, we consider an entropy criterion to estimate the number of clusters arising from a mixture model. This criterion is derived from a relation linking the likelihood and the classification likelihood of a mixture. Its performance is investigated through Monte Carlo experiments, and it shows favorable results compared to other classical criteria.},
