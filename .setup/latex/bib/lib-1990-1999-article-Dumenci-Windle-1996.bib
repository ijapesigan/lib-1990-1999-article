  abstract     = {Utilized the latent trait-state model for estimating stable and changing components of depressive symptomology in adolescents. The factorial structure of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) was assessed separately for males and females at 4 measurement occasions, at 6-mo intervals. The variance decomposition of general trait, state, specific trait, and random error parameters for the CES-D scores was estimated simultaneously and tested statistically. Parameter estimates indicated that the CES-D measured both trait- and state-depression about equally well, and that the trait-specific variance parameter was statistically significant, but substantially smaller than those associated with general trait- and state-depression. Findings are discussed with regard to depressive mood fluctuations among adolescents and the potential usefulness of the latent trait-state model to capture such dynamic features of development.},
