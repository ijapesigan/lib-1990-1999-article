  abstract = {The constructs of intelligence and ego-resiliency are discussed. The personality implications of ``pure intelligence'' and ``pure ego-resilience'' were identified. Intelligence (IQ) was indexed by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) and ego-resiliency by an inventory scale. Residual scores measuring ``pure intelligence'' and ``pure ego-resilience'' were correlated with the items of the observer based California Q-sort, used to describe participants. Persons relatively high on ego-resilience tend to be more competent and comfortable in the ``fuzzier'' interpersonal world; persons defined primarily by raw IQ tend to be effective in the ``clearer'' world of structured work but tend also to be uneasy with affect and less able to realize satisfying human connections. Gender differences exist in the relations of ego-resilience and intelligence and in their adaptive relevance.},
